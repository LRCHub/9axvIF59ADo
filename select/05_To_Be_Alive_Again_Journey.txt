Doin' time where it takes you
You know it's time that can break you
We get caught in a moment
Just sleep walkin' most of our lives

In your mind when you need it
With a song to help you believe it
You can reinvent your world
Anytime you like

To be alive again
Wakin' up from where you been
Younger now than you were then
You're comin' 'round again
Do you remember when
Life was so much simpler then?
Like summer nights that never end
To be alive again

Find the smile
You've been missin'
There's someone that you could be kissin'
Ooh so open your eyes and see what's been there all along

Letting go of your feelings
With doubt and fear you don't need it
Break the chains of the heart of the soul
That's been waiting so long

To be alive again
Wakin' up from where you been
Younger now than you were then
You're comin' 'round again
Do you remember when
Life was so much simpler then?
Like summer nights that never end
To be alive again

You're not among the walkin' wounded anymore
There's a time to fall
There's a time to rise above it all

To be alive again
Wakin' up from where you been
Younger now than you were then
You're comin' 'round again
Do you remember when
Life was so much simpler then?
Like summer nights that never end
To be alive again
(Alive again)

(Alive again)
To feel alive again
(Alive again)
Yeah, you make me feel alive again, yeah
To feel again
To feel alive again
